Prerequisites
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously, you will need a functional version of Moodle 2.x.x, full access to 
the root folder and admin rights within your Moodle installation.

You will need a Red5 Server. We suggest version 8 or above. Red5 can be 
downloaded at the following site: http://code.google.com/p/red5/
Select the proper version for your OS. Once installed you will need to install 
ofla demo. Follow the instructions from Red5.


Once you have Red5 installed, either write down the IP address of your server 
or get a FQDN. You will need it in order for Red5 to work.
NOTE: Using localhost will NOT work.
